We have an existing pitch deck web app with        
  animations already built. The design uses animated 
   backgrounds with blurred glass panels in the      
  foreground. Do not touch the design system,        
  animations, or background. Your only job is to     
  populate each slide with the right content and     
  wire up the transition behavior correctly.         
                                                     
  TRANSITION BEHAVIOR — THIS APPLIES TO EVERY SLIDE: 
  Every slide follows this exact sequence:           
                                                     
  Slide transition animation plays first             
  Only once that animation is fully complete does    
  content begin appearing                            
  Content elements appear gradually, one after       
  another, never all at once                         
  When the user clicks to advance, content           
  disappears first, then the slide transition        
  animation plays                                    
  Same sequence every time: content out, animation,  
  new content in                                     
                                                     
  This applies to every single slide without         
  exception.                                         
                                                     
  SLIDE 6 IS A SPECIAL CASE:                         
  Slide 6 has two content states on the same slide.  
  The background animation never stops or            
  transitions. It keeps running. When the user       
  advances from state 1 to state 2, only the content 
   changes. The animation stays untouched. Content   
  disappears gradually, then new content appears     
  gradually. No slide transition animation between   
  state 1 and state 2, just a content swap. When the 
   user advances past state 2, the full slide        
  transition plays as normal.                        
                                                     
  TOTAL SLIDES: 9 (slide 6 has 2 content states,     
  counts as 1 slide)                                 
                                                     
  Slide 1: Cover                                     
  Full screen. Centered.                             
  Large: "Menius"                                    
  Below: "Closing the gap between what AI can do and 
   how it's used."

  Slide 2: The Founders                              
  Two glass panels side by side. This slide exists   
  to establish that angels are betting on people     
  first. Finn owns distribution. Lucas owns          
  technical. Both are AI power users. The split is   
  intentional and should feel complementary, not     
  competitive.                                       
  Left panel — Finn Jennen, CEO:

  Right panel — Lucas Fedronic, CTO:

  Single line centered at the bottom of the slide,   
  smaller and softer than the rest: "Met in a pizza  
  line at a hackathon. Lucas kept building after it  
  was over."                                         
                                                     
  Slide 3: The Problem                               
  This slide needs to land the tension immediately.  
  The gap between what AI can do and how the average 
   person uses it is vast and growing. Use contrast  
  to make it visceral.                               
  Headline: "The gap is massive. And it's getting    
  bigger."                                           
  Two contrasting panels appearing side by side:     
  Left — "Average user":                             
  Uses ChatGPT like Google. Types a question. Moves  
  on.                                                
  Right — "Power user":                              
  Builds agentic employees that think and execute    
  autonomously.                                      
  Single line below both panels: "Most people don't  
  know what they don't know. That's the problem. And 
   the opportunity."                                 
                                                     
  Slide 4: The Insight                               
  This slide establishes that Menius didn't guess.   
  It talked to over a thousand people before writing 
   a line of code. Three insights appear one at a    
  time, each with a headline and one supporting      
  line.                                              
  Headline: "1,000+ people surveyed. 70 user         
  interviews. Before we wrote a line of code."       
  Three blocks, stacked, appearing one after         
  another:                                           
  The anxiety is real and growing.                   
  People know they're falling behind on AI. They     
  have no clear path forward.                        
  Every existing solution starts too broad.          
  Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, NotebookLM try to     
  teach everything and hope to teach it well. We     
  start with one skill, AI literacy, dial it in      
  completely, then reverse engineer it to adjacent   
  skills. Depth compounds. Breadth doesn't.          
  Every existing solution is static.                 
  By the time you finish a Coursera course it's      
  already outdated. You can't learn AI by watching a 
   video. You learn it by using it.                  
                                                     
  Slide 5: The Solution                              
  This slide introduces Menius as an agent, not a    
  course. The product visual carries the weight      
  here. Text is minimal. The screenshot or mockup    
  does the explaining.                               
  Headline: "Menius is an agent that lives in your   
  browser."                                          
  Three lines appearing one at a time:               
                                                     
  Figures out your workflow and your role            
  Finds the AI tools that actually matter for your   
  job                                                
  Teaches you those tools inside the tools           
  themselves                                         
                                                     
  Below the text: product flow visual. Onboarding →  
  personalized roadmap → Chrome extension guiding    
  the user live inside an actual AI tool. Use a real 
   screenshot or mockup if available in the          
  codebase. This is the most visual slide in the     
  deck. Let it breathe.                              
                                                     
  Slide 6: Strategy — The Funnel                     
  One slide. Same background animation running       
  continuously through both content states. No slide 
   transition between state 1 and state 2. Only the  
  content swaps.                                     
  State 1 — The Funnel:                              
  Headline: "One watertight funnel. Two streams of   
  signal."                                           
  Full slide is a clean funnel diagram, top to       
  bottom, centered, lots of breathing room:          
  Multiple channels → Website → Onboarding (every    
  step tracked, A/B tested continuously) → Hard      
  paywall                                            
  Nothing else on this state. The funnel visual is   
  the entire content. Let it breathe.                
  State 2 — The Two Signals:                         
  Same background, same slide. Content from state 1  
  disappears gradually. New content appears          
  gradually in two halves.                           
  Left half — Pre-paywall, Distribution:             
  Everything before the paywall feeds distribution.  
  How we frame the problem, improve messaging, and   
  optimize for conversion.                           
  Right half — Post-paywall, Product:                
  People who paid out of their own pocket. We        
  interview every one. Their feedback drives every   
  product decision. Nothing is built on assumption.  
                                                     
  Slide 7: Traction                                  
  Numbers large and clean. Each appears one at a     
  time with generous space between them. No          
  decoration. Let the numbers speak.                 
                                                     
  550 waitlisted                                     
  70 active users                                    
  4 paying customers — no friends, no family — at    
  $49                                                
  $196 in revenue                                    
  $100K investment offer received                    
                                                     
                                                     
  Slide 8: Business Model                            
  Three stages appearing one at a time sequentially: 
  Now: $49 lifetime access while we build retention. 
  Next: $20/month subscription — consumer and        
  enterprise per-seat. Companies pay per employee.   
  Long-term: We live inside users' browsers and      
  workflows. The usage analytics we collect — which  
  tools people use, how they use them, where they    
  get stuck — is data AI companies will pay for. We  
  sell it or build better products from it.          
                                                     
  Slide 9: Thank You                                 
  Clean. Minimal. Centered. No noise.

  One closing line at the bottom: "The gap is        
  closing."                                          
                                                     
  RULES — NON-NEGOTIABLE:                            
  Do not touch the animation system, the background, 
   or any existing design tokens. Only populate      
  content into existing slide components. Every      
  element on every slide appears gradually, never    
  all at once. Content always waits for the slide    
  transition animation to finish before it starts    
  appearing. When the user advances, content         
  disappears before the animation plays. Slide 6 is  
  the exception: the animation never transitions,    
  only the content swaps. Generous whitespace on     
  every slide. The background is the visual. The     
  content is the message. They never compete. so the 
   code that is now running on port localhost 5173,  
  the one with the beautiful automations of San      
  Francisco, the city, the skyline, the sun, earth,  
  the galaxy, the Milky Way, and all of that stuff,  
  the content that it has right now, the text that   
  is overlaid with it, we're going to change a       
  little. We're not going to change any of the       
  animations, any of the background, but the text I  
  just pasted in is going to be used as a reference  
  for what we're doing for the content that we're    
  going to place on top of that. It's going to be on 
   blurred glass backgrounds and it's going to have  
  the content that I just pasted in so each slide is 
   actually useful and is actually conveying value   
  to our investors
